1. Write an SQL query that selects the names of the opinion giver and receiver(opinion_giver and opinion_receiver), along with their current (current_opinion) and previous (previous_opinion) opinions. Include only records where the current opinion differs from the previous opinion. Sort the results first by the name of the opinion giver and then by the name of the opinion receiver - both in ascending alphabetical order.

```sql
SELECT
    giver.name AS opinion_giver,
    receiver.name AS opinion_receiver,
    current_opinion,
    previous_opinion
FROM
    people_opinions
INNER JOIN
    people AS giver ON people_opinions.opinion_giver_id = giver.person_id
INNER JOIN
    people AS receiver ON people_opinions.person_id = receiver.person_id
WHERE
    current_opinion != previous_opinion
OR  (current_opinion IS NULL and previous_opinion IS NOT null)
OR  (current_opinion IS NOT NULL and previous_opinion IS NULL)
ORDER BY opinion_giver, opinion_receiver
```
